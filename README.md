# Computer Graphics

This repository holds the solutions for all the assignments from the Computer Graphics course I took at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics as part of the graduate study.

The first part of the course uses the Canvas API. (directory `1`)
The second part uses WebGL to implement shaders. (directory `2`).
